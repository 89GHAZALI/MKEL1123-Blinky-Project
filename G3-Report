TOPIC: SETTING BLINKY APPLICATION INSTRUCTION
Material: ARM Microprocessor (Nucleo-F446RE), USB A-mini-B & STM32CUBEIDE.1.8.0 SOFTWARE & Computer.
1.	Install & open the STM32CUBEIDE.1.8.0 application by connecting the arm microprocessor to the computer using USB A to mini-B.
2.	Click start new STM32 project. Properties for STM32 project will come up.
3.	Select Board Selector-NUCLEO-F446RE then click ‘Next’.
4.	Name the Project-Blinky Project-Finish- Board Project Options (properties)-click ‘Yes’-Open Associated Perspective(properties)-click ‘Yes’.
5.	Set LD2 [Green LED] on the board-PA5 is the port connected to the build in LED in microprocessor to blink- click ‘Save’- click Device Configuration Tool Code Generation (to generate the code)-click ‘Yes’. (Already set by the application.no need to change the configuration).
6.	Use ‘main.c’- Go to ‘while’ coding area. Others coding area no need to code first.
   While(1)
{ 
HAL_GPIO_WritePin(GPIOA,GPIO PIN_5, 1); 
HAL_Delay (1000);

HAL_GPIO_WritePin(GPIOA,GPIO PIN_5, 0); 
HAL_Delay (1000);
}	

a)	Click CTRL + Spacebar and select this command (HAL_GPIO_WritePin (GPIOX, GPIO Pin, Pinstate);
b)	Click CTRL + Spacebar and select this command HAL_Delay(uint32_Delay); void 
c)	Change instruction inside the bracket as state by the left instruction coding shown.
d)	Pinstate-1(ON), 0(OFF) both states are needed due the while instruction is loop state instruction.

7.	Click ‘Save’ and Run LED.
8.	After Run LED- Edit Configuration Properties-Click ‘OK’- ST-LINK Firmware Verification Properties-Click ‘Yes’.
9.	ST-Linkupgrade 3.3.6 (properties)- Click ‘Open in update mode’- Click ‘Upgrade’.
10.	Run again the compiler to be compile into the arm microprocessor.
11.	The LD2 on the dev. Board can be observe which the LED will blink according to the delay time that set up on the ‘While’ instruction.
12.	Disconnect microprocessor to the computer by removing USB application on the computer.
